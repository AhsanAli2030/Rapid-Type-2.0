2.Accuracy:
  Accuracy of words:
  => Percentage of correct words over total words.
  Accuracy of Chars:
  => Percentage of correct chars over total chars.
3.Total Time:
4.Total Words Typed:
5.Total Characters Typed:

6.Correct Entries:
    Correct Words: Number of correctly typed words.

7.Incorrect Entries:
    Wrong Words: Number of incorrectly typed words.
    Wrong Characters: Number of incorrectly typed characters
    Wrong Spaces: Number of incorrect or misplaced spaces.
8.Skipped Entries:
    Skipped Words: Number of words the user didn't attempt to type.
    Skipped Characters: Number of characters skipped during typing.

9.Timing Metrics:
    Time Spent Per Word: Average time taken to type a word.
    Peak Typing Speed: Highest WPM recorded during the test.
    Lowest Typing Speed: Lowest WPM recorded during the test.
    Average Typing Speed: Overall average speed, considering all the fluctuations during the test.
10.Correction Behavior:
    Backspace Count: Total number of times the backspace key was pressed
    Corrections per Minute: Number of corrections made using backspace per minute.
    Undoing Wrong Words: Number of incorrect words corrected before hitting space.
    Undoing Wrong Characters: Number of incorrect characters corrected before moving to the next character.
    Redo Attempts: Words retyped after the user realizes a mistake.
11.Error Distribution:
    Error Rate per Word: Average number of errors per word.
    Error Rate per Character: Average number of errors per character.
12.Character-level Insights
    Most Missed Letters: List of letters the user missed or got wrong most frequently.
    Most Correct Letters: List of letters the user typed correctly the most.
13.Word-level Insights:
    Most Frequent Incorrect Word: The word the user consistently mistyped.
    Most Frequent Correct Word: The word the user consistently typed correctly.
14.User Interaction
    Consecutive Correct Characters: The longest streak of correct characters typed.
    Consecutive Correct WOrds: The longest streak of correct Words typed.
    Consecutive Incorrect Characters: The longest streak of incorrect characters typed.
    Consecutive Incorrect Words: The longest streak of incorrect Words typed.


                                        Graphs:
1. Line Graphs
=>WPM Over Time: Plot WPM at various points during the test to show speed fluctuations.
=>CPM Over Time: Track CPM to observe character input rate changes over time.
=>Accuracy Over Time: Track how accuracy changes as the user progresses through the test.
=>Errors Over Time: Visualize when and how frequently errors occur throughout the test.
=>Words/Characters Typed Over Time: Show the rate of word or character typing over the test duration.
=>Backspace Count Over Time: Track how often the backspace key was pressed over time.

2. Bar Charts
=>Correct vs. Incorrect Words:
=>Correct vs. Incorrect Characters:
=>Skipped Words or Characters:

3. Pie Charts
=>Correct vs. Incorrect Words/Characters: Show the proportion of correct vs. incorrect words or characters in a pie chart.
=>Typing Accuracy: Visualize typing accuracy as a percentage of correct characters out of total characters.
=>Error Distribution (e.g., Typing vs. Spacing): Represent the distribution of errors between mistyped characters, wrong spaces, and wrong punctuation.
=>Time Spent on Each Section: Show the proportion of time spent on different sections of the text or during different phases of the test (beginning, middle, end).

4. Histograms
=>Distribution of Errors by Type: Show the frequency of different types of errors (e.g., mistyped characters, skipped words, incorrect spaces).
=>WPM Distribution: Show the distribution of WPM values throughout the test (e.g., is the speed mostly between 50-60 or 60-70?)

5.Area Charts
=>Cumulative Words Typed: Show the cumulative number of words typed over time.
=>Cumulative Errors: Track how errors accumulate over the course of the test.
=>Cumulative Backspaces: Show the accumulation of backspace presses over time.

6.Bubble Charts
=>WPM vs. Errors with Backspace Count: Show the relationship between WPM and errors, with the size of each bubble representing backspace count.
=>CPM vs. Accuracy with Skipped Words: Similar to WPM vs. Errors, but using CPM and accuracy, with bubble size indicating skipped words.

7.Gauge Charts
=>WPM Gauge: Display WPM as a gauge, where the needle shows the current or average typing speed.
=>Accuracy Gauge: Show the current accuracy percentage as part of a full 100% scale.
